## How to run the main script (main.py)
  Run "python 3832/main.py"
  
## Training Data we Used
  We used the training data given to us in the initial instructions of the project. The link to our training dataset is https://github.com/iabufarha/iSarcasmEval/blob/main/train/train.En.csv in the iSarcasmEval github folder. We only used the English version and not Arabic. We then used a mixture of code from homework 2 and outside sources to generate out model. 

## Goal of Project
  The goal of our project is using a preloaded dataset of tweets for training, our program will be able to detect what's sarcasm or not. We use the fundamentals we've learned in NLP (for example, Homework 2). 
  
## Things to Note
  Out prediction.csv file is out output file located in 3832/prediction.csv. It has the tweets with the corresponding prediction. You can find the output of our F1 score once everything has run. Out best f1 score has been around 0.65. I include a picture of our model evaluation outputs in the github folder.
